Parallax Scrolling Methods

These are a couple of scrolling methods that I tested out for the creation of my portfolio site, http://technecreative.com. 

The first one relies heavily on CSS3 and the 3dtransform style but offered inconsistent cross platform performance (IE issues). This one is inside the z-transform folder.

The second method is the one I ultimately implimented on my portfolio site. This one has much more javascript and listens to the scroll and mouse wheel to create the parallax effect. This one is in the javascript-mouse-listener folder.

While the javascript-mouse-listener was the one I used with my portfolio there several adjustments and workarounds that were specific to my implementation that are not shown in this example. For the fully implimented file please see https://github.com/reversenorm/reversenorm.github.io which is hosting the content on http://technecreative.com.
