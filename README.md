Parallax Scrolling Methods

These are a couple of scrolling methods that I tested out for the creation of my portfolio site, http://technecreative.com. 

The first one relies heavily on CSS3 and the 3dtransform style but offered inconsistent cross platform performance (IE issues). This one is titled ParallaxTester_zTransformBased.html

The second method is the one I ultimately implimented on my portfolio site. This one has much more javascript and listens to the scroll and mouse wheel to create the parallax effect. This one is titled ParallaxTester_ScrollBased.html
